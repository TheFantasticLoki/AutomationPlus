# Mods for Oxygen Not Included

## Installing local

[See here for mod guide](https://github.com/Cairath/Oxygen-Not-Included-Modding/wiki/Introduction#your-first-mod)

There is a post-build script that will automatically copy the dlls into a local path.  This may fail if those directories are not created, so please make the target directory first at `%25USERPROFILE%25\OneDrive\Documents\Klei\OxygenNotIncluded\mods\Local\$(ProjectName)`

This assumes you are on windows and use onedrive directory synchroinization for your documents path.  If those don't apply, then manually copying to the target location is in order (and ignoring the post-build build error)
